A versatile image handling class that supports multiple input formats and conversions.

This class can handle images from various sources including URLs, file paths, base64 strings,
NumPy arrays, PyTorch tensors, and PIL Images. It provides methods for converting between
different image formats and serialization capabilities.

#### Attributes

- `data (PIL.Image.Image)`: The internal PIL Image representation of the image data.

#### Examples

>>> # From URL
>>> img = Image(data="http://example.com/image.jpg")
>>>
>>> # From file
>>> img = Image(data="file:/path/to/data.png")
>>>
>>> # From base64
>>> img = Image(data="base64_encoded_string")
>>>
>>> # From numpy array
>>> img = Image(data=numpy_array)
>>>
>>> # From PyTorch tensor
>>> img = Image(data=torch_tensor)
